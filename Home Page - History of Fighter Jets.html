        <header>What are fighter jets?</header>
        <p class="intro-text">Fighter jets are advanced military aircraft designed for high-speed combat. They are equipped with powerful armament, radar systems, and often feature stealth technology. Over the decades, each generation of fighter jets has advanced in terms of speed, capability, and weaponry.</p>
        <p>Fighter jets have been an essential part of military air forces worldwide, and their technological evolution has dramatically shaped modern warfare. Let's take a quick look at the history and evolution of these incredible machines.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <header>First Generation (1943 - 1950)</header>
        <p>The first fighter jet ever was the Me 262, developed by Nazi Germany during World War II. It was the beginning of a new era in aviation. This generation is defined by the use of jet engines instead of piston engines, marking the shift to faster and more powerful aircraft.</p>

        <p>Some of the notable fighter jets from the first generation include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>P-80 Shooting Star</li>
            <li>De Havilland Vampire</li>
